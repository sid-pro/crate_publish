//Now we see to upload our code to crates.io

// first write the documentation comments so other people can understand how to use the code 
// the documentation comments are starts with /// and use markdown for formatting and //! for describing crates and modules

// Documentation comments within items are useful for describing crates and modules especially.
// Use them to explain the overall purpose of the container to help your users understand the crateâ€™s organization.

// currently commenting this till line 34 we can uncomment and see the output cargo doc --open
/* 
//! # My Crate
//!
//! `my_crate` is a collection of utilities to make performing certain

/// Add one to the number given
/// 
/// # Examples
/// 
/// ```
/// let arg = 5;
/// let answer = crate_publish::add_one(arg);
/// 
/// assert_eq!(answer,6);
/// ```

// we can build the HTML documentation of our crate by using command cargo doc --open
// pub fn add_one(x:i32)->i32{
//     x+1
// }

// if we run cargo test than the example written in documentation will run

// we have a library called art conatins two module kinds and utils
// An art library with items organized into kinds and utils modules
